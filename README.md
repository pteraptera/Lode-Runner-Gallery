Of course reject this pull request - I am just trying to contact you with a few questions.

First, thanks for the nice work here.  So I see you have many of the different puzzle sets from different versions of LodeRunner.  I had previously had LegendReturns and MMR but cannot get the embedded puzzles there or at least don't know how to access them.  I assume they are hardcoded into the program.  I have been to the MMR rewrite site, but I have never seen the extra puzzles in those downloads.  I am wondering where I can get all the puzzle sets you list here.  I suppose it is not possible to include them in the actual repository you have due to copyright or something.  My email is same as github account name at yahoo dot com.

I found a site that has some of the Professional, Championship, Revenge puzzles for the Classic LR version though in a format that won't work for MMR.  The Championship puzzles have been available in MMR format for some time, but I have never seen the others.  I am currently taking the Pro ones and creating them in MMR. just over 2/3 the way complete though not all are solvable with the MMR rules.  I am changing some of them that are obviously not solvable but haven't tried everyone to make sure.  Might be able to create the screenshots and schmatics like you have here also if you are interested.  That looks to me like you took a great deal of time to do what you have here. Again, Thanks!

**WHAT:**<br>
Screenshots of individual levels, data points (origin, 1-player vs. 2-player, "world" information, and title), trivia, pointers to walkthroughs. Essentially a catalog of official LR levels.

**WHY:**<br>
What makes Lode Runner so awesome is ingeniousness of individual levels, each of which constitutes a puzzle to solve, yet there hasn't been an easy "internet way" to reference them. With this repository, I finally can! 
Here is [Level 024 entitled "Think Ahead"](LRO_MMR_1P/index.md#level-024), which mystifies me every single time. 
How about <a href="LRO_MMR_1P/pngs_labeled/LRO_MMR_1P - 166 - REEF - MONK RAIN.png">this one aptly named "Monk Rain"</a>, or a [secret Easter-egg level](LRO_MMR_EE1P/index.md#level-002) that paid homage to an even more classic puzzle.  

<!-- [Level 083 "Disorderly Dig"](LRO_MMR_1P/index.md#level-083) which is a long-time favorite -->

**HOW:**<br>
Screenshots were taken on [_Lode Runner: The Legend Returns_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lode_Runner:_The_Legend_Returns) (1994) and [_Lode Runner Online: Mad Monks' Revenge_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lode_Runner_Online:_The_Mad_Monks%27_Revenge) (1995), emulated and patched to run on Windows 10. 
Apart from `LR_TLR`, all screenshots were taken on _Lode Runner Online_ (1995), including on the level packs originally published on a different platform (PlayStation, etc.). They were produced using LRO-compatible `.pzl`copies, which were ported by fan community. Screenshots for such packs therefore may deviate from their original, "native" forms. 
Level titles and other additional information were scraped or keyed in by myself. 
Level trivia was sourced from fan sites (Jason Summers, etc.) and more.

| [`level_data.tsv`](LRO_MMR_1P/level_data.tsv) 	| 4 columns: pack ID, level #, world ID, title |
| [`level_data_SUPPL.tsv`](LRO_MMR_1P/level_data_SUPPL.tsv) | Contains supplementary information on levels. Currently 3 columns: trivia, two walkthrough sources.

**World ID code**: <br>
There are 12 of them: 
`MOSS` ([Moss world](LRO_MMR_1P/pngs/001.png)), `FUNG` ([Fungus world](LRO_MMR_1P/pngs/016.png)), `ANCI` ([Ancient world](LRO_MMR_1P/pngs/031.png)), `CRYS` ([Crystal world](LRO_MMR_1P/pngs/046.png)), `ICEW` ([Ice world](LRO_MMR_1P/pngs/061.png)), `FOSS` ([Fossil world](LRO_MMR_1P/pngs/076.png)), `LAVA` ([Lava world](LRO_MMR_1P/pngs/091.png)), `PHOS` ([Phosphorus world](LRO_MMR_1P/pngs/106.png)), `DARK` ([Dark world](LRO_MMR_1P/pngs/121.png)), `INDU` ([Industrial world](LRO_MMR_1P/pngs/136.png)), `ASTR` ([Astral world](LRO_MMR_1P/pngs/151.png)), `REEF` ([Reef world](LRO_MMR_1P/pngs/166.png)).

## Want to Play?
All of these puzzle packs are bundled with Quark Robot's excellent re-implementation, [_Mad Monks' Revenge: Definitive Edition_](http://mmr.quarkrobot.com/). This is a faithful remake of the game that installs and runs natively on all modern operating systems (Windows, OS X, and Linux). Enjoy!
